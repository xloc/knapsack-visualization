# knapsack-visualization

Visualize the DP table used for solving the knapsack problem.

While dynamic programming offers an efficient solution to the knapsack problem, 
it can be tough to grasp, especially when trying to mentally process the DP table. 
Drawing the table on paper may not take away the complexity and lacks an interactive touch. 

This tool bridges the gap by visualizing the DP table in an interactive manner using Vue.js. 
By hovering over each cell, users can gain insights into the interplay of values 
and understand how each value is derived based on previous calculations.

## Usage

1. **Input Data** to textfield at the top
   - Data should be presented in 3 lines: 
     1. Weights of the items, separated by commas
     2. Profits of the items, separated by commas
     3. Maximum weight limit.

2. **Inspect the DP table** populated below

3. **Hover on table cells** to view the value's dependencies
